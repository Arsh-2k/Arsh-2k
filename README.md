### 🚀 About Me

- 🎓 I'm a CSE undergrad passionate about tech, logic, and building useful things.
- 💻 Currently exploring: **Programming**, **Data Structures & Algorithms**, and **Web Development**
- 🧠 I enjoy solving real-world problems through code — and making things that *don’t just run*, but *matter*.
- ♟️ Chess, geopolitics, and algorithmic thinking keep me sharp.
- ✨ Goal: Contribute to Open Source and build projects that speak louder than words.
